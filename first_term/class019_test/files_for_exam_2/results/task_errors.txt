1 ) 
		Develop a program named FirstName_LastName_ClassNumber_710716f5.rb

		1. You are given an argument for a folder with files.
		1.1. If there are other arguments they should be discarded..
		2. In this folder there is a CSV file, containing file names, along with other file formats.
		3. Parse the CSV file.
		4. Find all files that have 2 "_" in them including extensions.
		5. Calculate their file name length including extensions.
		6. Sort the result by Length DESC.
		7. Produce a result in JSON format named 710716f5.json:

			{
				"File1":"Length1"
				"File2":"Length2"
				...
				"FileN":"LengthN"
			}
	
Problem: 
1) It would be way easier if we had an example of the CSV file and how the rows are made.
Something like "example,file,rb", because I was not sure what exactly the format of the CSV is. 

Also what does "along with other file formats" exactly means?
