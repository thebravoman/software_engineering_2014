An atom is the smallest unit of matter that defines the chemical elements. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is made up of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small: the size of atoms is measured in picometers - trillionths (10-12) of a meter.

Every atom is composed of a nucleus made of one or more protons and usually an equal or similar number of neutrons (except hydrogen-1, which has no neutrons). Protons and neutrons together are called nucleons. The nucleus is surrounded by one or more electrons. Over 99.94% of the atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has a surplus or deficit of electrons relative to protons, then it has an overall positive or negative charge, and is called an ion.
