<a href = "solid.html"> Solid </a> is one of the four fundamental states of <a href = "matter.html"> matter </a>( the others being liquid, gas, and plasma). It is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to changes of shape or volume. Unlike a liquid, a<a href = "solid.html"> solid </a>object does not flow to take on the shape of its container, nor does it expand to fill the entire volume available to it like a gas does. The <a href = "atom.html"> atoms </a> in a<a href = "solid.html"> solid </a>are tightly bound to each other, either in a regular geometric lattice( crystalline <a href = "solid.html"> solids </a>, which include metals and ordinary ice) or irregularly( an amorphous<a href = "solid.html"> solid </a>such as common window glass).
