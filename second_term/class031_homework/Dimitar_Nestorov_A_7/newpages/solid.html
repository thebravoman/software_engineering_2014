<a href="solid.html" title="Solid">Solid</a> is one of the four fundamental states of <a href="matter.html" title="matter">matter</a> (the others being liquid, gas, and plasma). It is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to changes of shape or volume. Unlike a liquid, a <a href="solid.html" title="solid">solid</a> object does not flow to take on the shape of its container, nor does it expand to fill the entire volume available to it like a gas does. The atoms in a solid are tightly bound to each other, either in a regular geometric lattice (crystalline solids, which include metals and ordinary ice) or irregularly (an amorphous solid such as common window glass).
