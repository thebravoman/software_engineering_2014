An<a href = "atom.html"> atom </a>is the smallest unit of <a href = "matter.html"> matter </a> that defines the chemical elements. Every <a href = "solid.html"> solid </a>, liquid, gas, and plasma is made up of neutral or ionized <a href = "atom.html"> atoms </a>. <a href = "atom.html"> Atoms </a> are very small: the size of <a href = "atom.html"> atoms </a> is measured in picometers– trillionths( 10−12) of a meter. [ 1] 

Every<a href = "atom.html"> atom </a>is composed of a nucleus made of one or more protons and usually an equal or similar number of neutrons( except hydrogen-1, which has no neutrons). Protons and neutrons together are called nucleons. The nucleus is surrounded by one or more electrons. Over 99.94% of the<a href = "atom.html"> atom </a>s mass is in the nucleus. [ 2] The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that<a href = "atom.html"> atom </a>is electrically neutral. If an<a href = "atom.html"> atom </a>has a surplus or deficit of electrons relative to protons, then it has an overall positive or negative charge, and is called an ion.
