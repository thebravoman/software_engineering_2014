Develop a program named FirstName_LastName_ClassNumber_056026a5.rb;

1. You are given an argument for a path to CSV file:
1.1 if there are other arguments they should be discarded;
2. CSV contains students and is in format "Name,number";
3. Find all students with number = 7;
4. Sort by Name ASC and produce XML called "result.xml" which contains only the Names of the students you have found.

Example:
CSV:					
	Name5,7
	Name2,7			
	Name3,13					
	Name42,18				
	Name1,7			
output XML:
<students>
	<name>Name1</name>
	<name>Name2</name>
	<name>Name5</name>
</students>
