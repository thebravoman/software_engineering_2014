1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,060
Hands in the air!
don't turn around!

2
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:06,155
Okay.
don't turn around!

3
00:00:06,157 --> 00:00:07,962
Get on the ground!

4
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:09,826
Hurry up!
Give me your gun!

5
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:11,931
I said do it!

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,664
Your 211 pager.
Now!

7
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,537
Put it down!

8
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:22,808
Get out of here! Go!

9
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,186
The driver's calling it in!
Turn it up!

10
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:35,489
Come on!
Let's hurry up!

11
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:36,889
Go!

12
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:40,863
Let's go.

13
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:46,475
Come on! Come on!

14
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:54,655
It's this little cabin
in the hill country --

15
00:00:54,657 --> 00:00:57,118
rustic, charming,
very romantic.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,821
Rustic as in
no running water or...?

17
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:00,157
Well, would that
be a problem?

18
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,860
Well, when you said,
“Let's go away for the weekend”,

19
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,259
I was kind of hoping
for the kind of place

20
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,290
that leaves a mint on the pillow.
Ah.

21
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:07,257
Hey, Cho.
Hey.

22
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:09,392
We have three men
robbing an armored truck.

23
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:11,160
They subdued the guard,
unloaded the cash,

24
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:12,095
got out in 60 seconds.

25
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:14,397
Land speed record.
Any witnesses?

26
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:15,861
They gave us approximate
heights and weights,

27
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:17,165
but nothing
groundbreaking.

28
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:19,070
Tactics match a team
that's been knocking off

29
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:20,472
payday loan shops
around town.

30
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:22,041
But those were
two-man jobs.

31
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:23,789
Well, it sounds like
they made a new friend.

32
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:24,146
Yeah.

33
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:26,313
Bank manager says this is
the biggest cash delivery

34
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:27,681
of the year.

35
00:01:27,683 --> 00:01:30,312
$600,000 in wrapped bricks.

36
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:31,983
Any tracking devices
or dye packs?

37
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,285
They add those<i> after</i>
the cash is broken down.

38
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:35,548
Lucky robbers.

39
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,756
Luck is the planning
you don't see.

40
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:38,885
What kind
of planning?

41
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:40,221
You think someone
with the bank is involved.

42
00:01:40,223 --> 00:01:43,189
Seems likely. A score this big
literally gift-wrapped?

43
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:45,395
All right, we'll get surveillance up on
the bank employees.

44
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,732
Well, that sounds like a hassle.
Let's just ask them.

45
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:50,437
Pull footage from
the surveillance cameras

46
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,133
in the area.

47
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:56,171
Good morning. Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

48
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:58,405
Thank you.
Uh, quick question --

49
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,046
which one of you
was the accomplice

50
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:01,511
to the robbery
this morning?

51
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:03,016
Sorry. Who are you?

52
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:04,152
Patrick Jane, FBI.
You?

53
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:06,656
Gil Clark.
I'm the branch manager.

54
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:08,656
Did you just
accuse my people?

55
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:10,720
Gil, I did.
Agent Cho will explain.

56
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,928
Hi. How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

57
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,960
Sorry to hear
about the robbery.

58
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:15,464
So, what the hell
is going on here?

59
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:16,432
Just be patient, sir.

60
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:17,968
Sorry to hear
about the robbery.

61
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,135
This -- I mean,
this is outrageous.

62
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:21,735
No. Not really.
Not yet.

63
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:24,566
And thank you.
Well, that was my pleasure.

64
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:27,142
Uh, let me tell you something
about guilt.

65
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:30,941
It's physical -- increased
perspiration, racing heart.

66
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,612
But when I just shook
your hands,

67
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:35,643
most of you were
relatively calm and relaxed,

68
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:37,210
which is incredible
given the circumstances.

69
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:41,616
Except for, uh, you,
Ken Fletcher, senior teller.

70
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:44,047
Your heart, my friend,
is racing like a greyhound.

71
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,647
What is that
supposed to mean?

72
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:47,952
And your left hand
keeps touching your pocket.

73
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:49,593
What do you got in there?
Hmm?

74
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:51,657
Empty it.
It --

75
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:52,857
Now.

76
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:58,130
Looks like a burner.

77
00:02:58,132 --> 00:03:00,632
Phone you don't
want to be traced.

78
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:01,863
Who gave this to you,
sir?

79
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:03,535
I-I-I don't know.
I mean, I-I --

80
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:05,640
Answer the question.
Who gave this to you, sir?

81
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:07,810
I don't -- I-I-I just --
I-I --

82
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:10,880
Oh, no.
I think you killed him.

83
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:17,945

85
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,365
Fainting isn't evidence
of anything.

86
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:31,350
I'm hypoglycemic.
I didn't have breakfast.

87
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:33,053
My blood sugar
was in the basement.

88
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,852
So you got the burner phone
because of your blood sugar?

89
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,059
You doubled the cash order
at the bank this week.

90
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:41,858
Was that the blood sugar
talking?

91
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,070
My client is not answering
questions at this time.

92
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:49,109
I don't think Ken here,
with his health issues,

93
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,771
is really up
for prison.

94
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,746
So let's improve
his outlook.

95
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:55,841
Start with
the robbers' names.

96
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:58,649
What robbers?

97
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:00,480
I don't see any robbers.

98
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,951
Call me when you have
somebody in custody.

99
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,493
He's holding out.

100
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:17,124
He won't talk
until we have the others.

101
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,898
Maybe we can track them down
with his phone.

102
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,959
Yeah, try it.

103
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,527
Know what?
You run this one.

104
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,197
Might as well. You'll
be in charge soon enough.

105
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,660
You sure?

106
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:26,659
Yeah.

107
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:27,795
They're tired of hearing
my voice anyway.

108
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:29,098
All right.

109
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,968
So, my friend has this
league of legends team,

110
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,767
and they're playing a tournament
in Houston on Saturday.

111
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:37,669
I crush
league of legends.

112
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:39,037
You want to go?

113
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,172
That would be awesome.

114
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:41,700
I figure
we could drive down

115
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,971
and then maybe afterward
we could stick around

116
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:45,171
and have dinner.

117
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:46,506
Yeah.

118
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:49,410
Really?
Sure. Let's do it.

119
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:52,178
Cool. Yeah.
I'll let him know.

120
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,481
Hey.

121
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:55,345
Have you guys seen
Jane and Lisbon?

122
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:57,553
Lisbon went to get the rest
of the security video.

123
00:04:57,555 --> 00:04:59,721
Jane just said
he was running an errand.

124
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:01,721
Austin P.D.
found the getaway car

125
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:02,887
about a half-mile
from the bank.

126
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:03,991
No prints.

127
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:05,822
Tell them to dust it again
just to be sure.

128
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:06,958
Anything off the phone?

129
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,292
Fletcher made about
a dozen calls this week

130
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:10,587
to another burner --
no way to tell who has that one.

131
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:11,794
All right.

132
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:16,157
He must have been
calling the robbers.

133
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,894
They probably met in person
at least once, right?

134
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:21,062
That's a good point.

135
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:23,061
Can we use Fletcher's personal
phone to track his movements?

136
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:24,699
Definitely --
every location we visit

137
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,466
is tracked and time-stamped
on our phones.

138
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:28,930
I can use the cell tower hits
to track his path.

139
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:30,265
How long
will it take you?

140
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:31,401
10 minutes.
All right.

141
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:33,273
Text the list of locations
to me and Vega.

142
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:34,537
We'll canvass.
Let's go.

143
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:36,735
Okay.

144
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:46,748
Hey. I hear you were
getting locations for Cho.

145
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,286
Yeah,
I just sent them.

146
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:50,150
Oh, good.

147
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:54,929
Can I ask you about something,
outside of work?

148
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:57,392
W-well, it's -- it's not
totally outside of work.

149
00:05:57,394 --> 00:05:58,759
You asked Vega out.

150
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:00,861
How did you know?

151
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:03,394
Ah, this is not my first rodeo.
What's your question?

152
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,929
I'm trying to find
a restaurant.

153
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,328
And you want to know
how expensive.

154
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,528
Well, I don't want to
tip my hand.

155
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,368
I think you already
tipped your hand.

156
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,229
Okay, but how do I impress her
without coming on too strong?

157
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:15,197
Keep it casual.

158
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,205
Not a hole in a wall,
you know?

159
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:19,508
Tablecloths,
not necessarily white.

160
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,642
Okay.

161
00:06:22,644 --> 00:06:24,776
And, Wylie?

162
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:28,109
She already said yes.
That was the hard part.

163
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:29,404
Just try to have fun.

164
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:32,378
Oh, thanks.

165
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:42,709
Wylie sent the list.
There are...

166
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:45,243
14 locations
Fletcher visited.

167
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:46,915
We can
cover those today.

168
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,283
They're all over the county.
We wearing jetpacks?

169
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,683
We'll get it done.

170
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:53,521
If you say so.

171
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:02,189
You're definitely
taking over the team?

172
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:04,995
Yes.
Are you excited?

173
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:06,730
I don't really
think about it that way.

174
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:10,331
Isn't this something you've
wanted your entire career?

175
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,163
Yes.
So be excited about it.

176
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,138
I am.

177
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,702
Oh. Good.

178
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:21,167
So, are there any changes
you're going to make

179
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,662
when you take over?

180
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:24,133
Yeah. A new rule.

181
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:26,165
Rookie agents are seen
and not heard.

182
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,700
Good luck with that.

183
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:38,982
Hey.
Where have you been?

184
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:40,319
For your pillow.

185
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,615
Oh. Mints. Thank you.

186
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:46,626
I also got us a reservation
this weekend at the Alhambra.

187
00:07:46,628 --> 00:07:48,226
Resortish style place,
room service,

188
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:50,531
high-thread-count sheets.
I think you're gonna like it.

189
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,467
You didn't
have to do that.

190
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:54,802
No, I didn't, but I want to
spend some time alone with you,

191
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:56,665
and it should be
at some place that you like.

192
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,504
Well, are you gonna like it?
It doesn't sound very rustic.

193
00:07:58,506 --> 00:08:00,839
Yeah,
I'll find a tree.

194
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:02,238
Uh, this is
the security footage.

195
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,239
Yeah, uh,
could you, uh,

196
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:05,478
replay it back
from the beginning,

197
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,742
uh,
all at the same time?

198
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:07,910
Sure.

199
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:11,644
Stop it.

200
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:13,581
That's the Alpha.

201
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:15,317
He's the one in charge.

202
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,484
That's what I thought,
too.

203
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:18,517
He's the only one
who touches the money.

204
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,653
Uh, you see that guy over there
with the semi-automatic?

205
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:21,692
Mm-hmm.

206
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:23,155
He's the new crew member.

207
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:26,858
Uh, none of the previous robbery
victims reported heavy weaponry.

208
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,890
The big gun stands out.

209
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:30,026
Good eye.

210
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:32,236
You notice how the Alpha
never turns his back on him

211
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:33,204
and vice-versa?

212
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:34,501
They don't
trust each other.

213
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:37,110
The Alpha does turn his back
on the driver.

214
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:38,278
What does that mean?

215
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,143
Well, they're brothers,
obviously.

216
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,175
Brothers?

217
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:42,743
Well,
the Alpha has a limp.

218
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:45,079
It looks like he has a lift
in his left shoe.

219
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:46,783
That leg
must be shorter.

220
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:50,487
And the driver has
a very similar walk.

221
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,524
Different-size legs
is a genetic anomaly.

222
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:54,956
Brothers.

223
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,356
I'll go
tell Cho and Vega.

224
00:08:57,358 --> 00:09:00,459
Did I say you could
have one of those?

225
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,367
Number 4, 10 to go.

226
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:11,903
Those jetpacks sound
better and better.

227
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:13,871
Be with you
in a minute.

228
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:15,240
FBI.

229
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:17,578
I'm Agent Cho.
This is Agent Vega.

230
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,481
Okay.
What's this about?

231
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,145
Do you recognize
this guy?

232
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:24,114
He came in for breakfast
on Sunday.

233
00:09:24,116 --> 00:09:25,923
If you say so.

234
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:28,260
We get a lot of people
in here on the weekends.

235
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:29,893
Is there something wrong?

236
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:32,398
I'm busy.
I have customers.

237
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,367
Cho.

238
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:40,839
Lisbon's text said
two of the robbers

239
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,239
had trouble
with their left leg.

240
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:43,878
Mm-hmm.

241
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,244
See that table
back there?

242
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:48,747
Look at the boot
on that guy's left foot.

243
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:52,576
This is Cho.

244
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:55,911
I need backup
at 5219 Burnett Road.

245
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,478
Possible robbery suspects
inside.

246
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,656
Hey, guys.

247
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:08,593
Is there a problem?

248
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:11,098
No problem.
I just want to talk.

249
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,634
Why don't
we go outside?

250
00:10:12,636 --> 00:10:15,109
Let's get out of here.

251
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,744
Let me see your hands.
Don't move.

252
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:20,114
Stay calm, everybody.
don't panic.

253
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:21,146
And where's
the third guy?

254
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:23,387
What third guy?

255
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:31,769
I got this one! Go!

256
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:49,125
Drop the gun! Down on
the ground! Do it now!

257
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,631
Aah!
Tommy!

258
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,640
No!

259
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:02,538
Go! Go!

260
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:07,176
Go! Go!

261
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:17,788
Clear out.
Get out of the way.

262
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:22,756
Call 911.
Tell them officer down.

263
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:23,924
I need to find my phone.

264
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:25,092
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

265
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:26,261
I need to call it in,
Cho.

266
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:28,094
No, no, no.
They're coming. They're coming.

267
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:30,264
Okay, good.
Keep breathing, keep breathing.

268
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,639
Stay with me, okay?
Good. Good.

269
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:34,103
All right,
I just need you to calm down.

270
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:35,439
Good. All right. Now,
this is gonna hurt, all right?

271
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:37,639
Aah!
I know. I know.

272
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:38,911
I know. You're okay.
You're okay.

273
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:40,647
Keep breathing. Good,
good, good. Keep breathing.

274
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:41,943
Where are they?

275
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:44,014
Now, they're on their way.
They're on their way, okay?

276
00:11:44,016 --> 00:11:47,180
It hurts.
I know. I know. I know.

277
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:49,148
Just keep breathing.
Did I mess up?

278
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,348
No. No,
you did good, okay?

279
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,452
You did good. Yeah, yeah.
I did?

280
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:54,156
All right, now just keep
breathing for me.

281
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:56,589
Okay? Keep breathing.
Good. In, out.

282
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,398
Okay, you're doing good.

283
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Hey. Hey,
look at me, Michelle.

284
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:02,137
Michelle. Hey.
Just keep breathing.

285
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:05,737
Good.
Keep breathing.

286
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:08,474
Hey.
Michelle, look at me.

287
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:10,146
Look at me, Michelle.

288
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:57,085
Excuse me.

289
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:02,482
Is this where
Agent Vega worked?

290
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:03,586
Sorry?

291
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:06,258
I'm Detective Brian Portis,
Austin homicide.

292
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,994
I've been assigned
to Agent Vega's case.

293
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:10,089
She work here?

294
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:12,424
Yes.

295
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:14,989
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

296
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,165
Which was her desk?

297
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:21,931
I'm gonna have to ask
that nobody touch that

298
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:23,594
till I've had a chance
to go through it.

299
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,528
We know.

300
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,965
You know where I can find
Agent Abbott?

301
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,732
His office
is right around there.

302
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,434
Okay. Thanks.

303
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:54,255
I'm sorry about this.
Just a B.S. regulation.

304
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:55,583
You're not allowed
to investigate

305
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:58,220
the death of your own guy.
Yeah, I get it.

306
00:14:58,222 --> 00:15:00,452
We lost a man last year.

307
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:02,858
Sheriff's department
took over.

308
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,985
It's hard.

309
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,721
You want to be the one
to catch the bastards.

310
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:10,930
Point is, I know
what this is like.

311
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:12,960
Want you to know
I'm here to work with you.

312
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:16,331
Okay.

313
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,696
The diner hostess
opened right up.

314
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:21,228
The crew
were regulars.

315
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,668
We worked the video surveillance
and I.D.'d the suspects.

316
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,693
Aaron Brunell.
Goes by “Ace.”

317
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:32,495
seems to be the brains of the
operation, such as they are.

318
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:35,260
Tommy Brunell,
younger brother.

319
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,155
He's the one got shot.

320
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:39,196
Steve Sellers.

321
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,163
Long sheet,
lot of violent felonies.

322
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:45,865
He's the one
that shot your agent.

323
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:52,303
Apologies,
but I have to ask this.

324
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:54,272
Did Vega do anything
unusual this morning?

325
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:56,040
Anything different
about her?

326
00:15:57,913 --> 00:16:00,111
I don't know.
I didn't talk to her.

327
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:01,310
Not even
a “good morning.”

328
00:16:01,312 --> 00:16:03,382
it's okay.
I'll take that for a “no”.

329
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:05,117
Look, you need to
understand something.

330
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,316
You can
have the collar.

331
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:09,588
Your department
can take the credit.

332
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,684
I don't give a damn
about that.

333
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:15,125
But this case is ours.

334
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:18,723
And these men,
they belong to us.

335
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,418
Yeah, I get it.

336
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,219
Good.

337
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:28,380
I'm gonna need to talk to
the agent that was with her.

338
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:31,345
Okay.

339
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:40,343
You're Cho, right?
Portis, Austin P.D.

340
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:42,349
If you want to take some time
to clean up, that's fine.

341
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,644
I'm okay.

342
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:45,144
Seriously,
I can wait.

343
00:16:47,545 --> 00:16:50,142
All right.

344
00:16:56,936 --> 00:17:00,738
Detective Portis interviewing
FBI special Agent Kimball Cho

345
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,464
regarding the homicide
of Michelle Vega.

346
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,147
Can you walk me through
the events

347
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:10,110
that led up
to the shooting?

348
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:15,772
Vega and I went out canvassing
a little after 10:00.

349
00:17:15,774 --> 00:17:19,412
We were checking locations where
we believed the three suspects

350
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,179
had met up
with a co-conspirator.

351
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:25,649
We'd checked four locations
when we arrived at the diner.

352
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:29,352
I identified myself
to the hostess.

353
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:31,982
It was at this point that Vega
spotted two of our suspects.

354
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,588
She brought this
to my attention.

355
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:40,659
Hey. How did it go
with Portis?

356
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,690
Fine. Seems okay.

357
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:44,330
Okay.

358
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,658
Look, you know
I have to make the call.

359
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,931
Vega's file says that her
next-of-kin is an aunt in Tampa.

360
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,140
Did she ever mention
anyone else?

361
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:54,340
It's her father's sister.

362
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:56,507
She's the only living relative
as far as I know.

363
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,507
Okay. All right, well,
I thought I'd just check.

364
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,707
I'll make the call.

365
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,179
You don't have to.

366
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,443
Yeah, I do.

367
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:04,314
I was there.
I should do it.

368
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:09,849
Use my office.
Her number's on the computer.

369
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:13,680
Ms. Vega?

370
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:17,120
This is Kimball Cho.
I'm with the FBI in Austin.

371
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:21,718
Yes, uh,
it's about Michelle.

372
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:34,067
Is there
any more coffee?

373
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:36,202
Uh, actually, I think we're out.
I'll -- I'll make some more tea.

374
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:40,104
No. No, that's okay.
I'm fine.

375
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:47,005
You don't believe in
the afterlife at all, do you?

376
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:49,539
No.

377
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,935
I do.

378
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:55,710
Do you think
that's foolish?

379
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:59,707
No, of course not.

380
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:03,114
I just need to believe
that she's someplace.

381
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:06,145
Yeah. Yeah.

382
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:09,954
Austin P.D. might have
caught something.

383
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:19,426
A few minutes ago,
a gas station attendant

384
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,194
spotted three men in a minivan
matching our description.

385
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:23,530
They were
trying to buy bandages,

386
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:24,602
probably for
their wounded guy.

387
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:25,769
They didn't find
what they needed,

388
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,201
so they bolted.
Where?

389
00:20:27,203 --> 00:20:29,505
Windsor Park.
Ah.

390
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:31,041
Couple minutes head start
from the gas station.

391
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,641
They couldn't have gotten
more than a mile or so.

392
00:20:32,643 --> 00:20:34,974
We'll have officers
canvassing the whole area.

393
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:35,910
And a K-9 unit.

394
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:37,574
And a couple birds
in the air.

395
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:40,079
We might want to institute
a shelter-in-place order.

396
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:42,613
Uh, maybe we should all
just take a breath.

397
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:45,243
We got these guys contained.
We can find them right now.

398
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,314
Well, or they'll
see the cops running around

399
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:50,314
and the helicopters flying,
and they'll go into hiding.

400
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:53,123
No, when you're hunting
a wounded animal,

401
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,988
you don't just start
chasing it immediately.

402
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,028
You'll drive it
to ground.

403
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,492
What's
the alternative?

404
00:20:57,494 --> 00:21:01,365
Well, no dragnet,
no helicopters.

405
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,134
We make them feel safe.

406
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,302
Or they'll flee
and then we'll lose them.

407
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:06,975
Well, they're not thinking
about fleeing.

408
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:08,543
They have
more basic needs.

409
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:11,677
They were trying to find medical
supplies for their wounded man.

410
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,477
They can't go to
the hospital.

411
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,347
We could put our people
outside local drugstores,

412
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:17,546
let them come to us.

413
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:21,077
I said I'd work with you.
What do you want?

414
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,041
I say we go
with Jane's idea.

415
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:27,205
All right. How many drugstores
are inside that radius?

416
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:29,307
A dozen.

417
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:30,706
We're gonna need
some more bodies.

418
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,177
All right. We'll take it.

419
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:34,009
You stay back
and monitor the radio.

420
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:36,080
Sure.

421
00:21:41,953 --> 00:21:45,655
It's Caldwell.
I'm at location 1.

422
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:50,188
This is Cho, location 2.

423
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,356
Lisbon, location 7.

424
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:56,163
Abbott, location 10.

425
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:57,996
Swafford, location 4.

426
00:21:57,998 --> 00:22:01,898
Millovich, location 5.

427
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:12,234
Abbott, location 10.
I have one of them.

428
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,541
He just entered a drugstore --
1145 Terrapin.

429
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:24,612
Everybody move in.
We need eyes on all of them.

430
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:27,177
And keep it quiet.
No sirens, no lights.

431
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:44,421
Just left the drugstore,
headed south on Terrapin.

432
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:48,590
Turn the sirens off!

433
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:53,433
He knows we're here.

434
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,448
Brunell, drop the gun!

435
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,747
Let the woman go!

436
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:00,955
Go to hell!

437
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:03,987
Go!

438
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,957
Get in! Get in!

439
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:18,434
Suspects are traveling
in a gold minivan

440
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:19,737
with Texas license plates.

441
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:22,240
They have a hostage.
Maintain pursuit.

442
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:26,473
Do not -- I repeat,
do not -- engage.

443
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:58,080
They're inside?

444
00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:00,447
Yeah. The uniforms
couldn't stop them.

445
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:02,111
Drove right
into the garage.

446
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:04,518
The house belongs
to Susan Cofield.

447
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,383
Early 70s, diabetic.

448
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:07,655
We don't know
if they're allowing her access

449
00:24:07,657 --> 00:24:08,888
to her medications.

450
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,959
She lives with her nephew, Phil.
He's in there, too.

451
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:12,654
Has anyone
spoken to them?

452
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:14,125
Portis just did, but we
don't know what they said.

453
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:15,957
He had to go talk
to his superiors first.

454
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,157
We -- we have money,
jewelry. We --

455
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:25,692
Shut up.

456
00:24:25,694 --> 00:24:27,659
It's gonna be okay,
buddy.

457
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:30,132
Okay? Breathe, breathe.
Hey.

458
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,439
Aah, sorry.
Hey, hey, look at me.

459
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:36,575
Look at me.

460
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:39,279
I need you to breathe.
Okay?

461
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:41,511
It's gonna be okay.

462
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,460
Okay. What are
they asking for?

463
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:52,332
Food, a doctor
for the wounded guy,

464
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:53,396
a helicopter, and a pilot.

465
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:55,227
They really
are just making it up

466
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:56,435
as they're going along,
aren't they?

467
00:24:56,437 --> 00:24:58,802
Normally we should
establish trust,

468
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:00,538
try to humanize the hostages,

469
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,833
but I don't know
if that's gonna work.

470
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,369
I don't think these guys
have much compassion.

471
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:06,137
Well,
I wouldn't say that.

472
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:08,673
It's a question of who
they have compassion for.

473
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,946
These guys killed Vega.

474
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:11,946
Sellers did, not Ace.

475
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:13,746
They're in there

476
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:16,785
because he was trying to get
medicine for his brother.

477
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:18,584
That's compassion.

478
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,352
Should we send Tommy a doctor?

479
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,254
Trade that for releasing
one of the hostages?

480
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:23,955
Well, I was gonna say
the opposite.

481
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,186
Ace is desperate.

482
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:27,749
I-if we help him,
then we lose our best leverage.

483
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:29,948
Our best bet is to
just let Tommy suffer.

484
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,155
Sellers is in this
for the money.

485
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,020
I mean, he'd probably
just as well let Tommy die.

486
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:38,061
Well, that's even better.
We drive a wedge between them.

487
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:39,397
Divide and conquer.

488
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:42,333
Okay. Let's try it.

489
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:45,269
Is there anything
we can give them?

490
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:59,716
Try anything, she dies.

491
00:25:59,718 --> 00:26:02,714
I won't. Here.

492
00:26:02,716 --> 00:26:05,447
What about a doctor?

493
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:07,013
My brother's hurt
real bad.

494
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:09,418
Yeah,
you can have a doctor.

495
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,649
When?
As soon as you surrender.

496
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:18,316
<i> ...Altercation</i>
<i>with two Austin FBI agents</i>

497
00:26:18,318 --> 00:26:19,712
<i>at the Tastee pancake house.</i>

498
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:21,279
<i>Shots were fired.</i>
<i>One of the FBI agents was hit.</i>

499
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:22,782
What were you talking
to the cops about?

500
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:25,252
<i>She was pronounced dead at the hospital.</i>
Nothing.

501
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:26,460
<i>At this point, all three of</i>
<i>these armed men are holed up...</i>

502
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,484
We said no secrets.

503
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:30,586
I asked if we
can get a doctor.

504
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,153
They're not
gonna give you that

505
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:33,855
unless you give something up,
like one of them,

506
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:35,657
and there is no way in hell
I'm doing that.

507
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:36,925
He is dying.

508
00:26:36,926 --> 00:26:38,891
Yeah, and it's not my fault
the dude got himself shot.

509
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:41,659
<i>...as soon as</i>
<i>we have anything more.</i>

510
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:44,394
I'm not going back to jail
to save his sorry ass.

511
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,162
We agreed that we were
gonna get some help.

512
00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:48,728
Yeah, and that's before we had
a million cops on our ass.

513
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,798
Well, looks like
it's working.

514
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,029
You wanted division,
you got it.

515
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,733
Well, it's a good start,
but we need to stir the pot.

516
00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:59,900
Can you hear a television
on in there?

517
00:26:59,902 --> 00:27:01,570
Sounds like
the local news.

518
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:03,535
Probably watching
their own coverage.

519
00:27:03,537 --> 00:27:05,269
Excellent.

520
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:11,673
Can I talk to you?

521
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:15,474
I got a look inside.

522
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:17,546
I think if we went in,
we could take them out.

523
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:19,777
There's three armed men
in there. Things could get ugly.

524
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:21,817
What about the hostages?
I think we can keep them out of it.

525
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:23,217
And if we don't
do something soon,

526
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:24,448
they could get hurt,
or worse.

527
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,921
Jane says
he has a plan.

528
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:27,984
No.
He's improvising.

529
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:30,118
Now, I've followed Jane
down a lot of paths,

530
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,588
but I'm not sure
he's right this time.

531
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,923
You want to go in
and take these guys out?

532
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:37,353
Is that about...
payback for Vega?

533
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,686
Maybe.

534
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:41,885
What if it is?

535
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:48,657
Let's let Jane's plan
play out for a little bit.

536
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,561
In the meantime,
talk to S.W.A.T.

537
00:27:50,563 --> 00:27:52,329
Let them know
we might want to go in.

538
00:27:54,963 --> 00:27:56,568
Interesting.

539
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,633
Which of the hostage takers
are you negotiating with?

540
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,769
Sorry. Can't say.

541
00:27:59,771 --> 00:28:01,369
Can I at least quote you
by name, Mr. Jane?

542
00:28:01,371 --> 00:28:03,706
No, uh,
a well-placed source.

543
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:06,644
That works.

544
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:11,951
<i> Let's go now to our</i>
<i>reporter, Elizabeth Kerrigan,</i>

545
00:28:11,953 --> 00:28:13,056
<i>who is on the scene.</i>

546
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,160
<i>Elizabeth,</i>
<i>what are you hearing?</i>

547
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:16,360
<i> Thanks, George.</i>

548
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,497
<i>Officially,</i>
<i>no deal has been made,</i>

549
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:21,328
<i>but a well-placed source</i>
<i>tells me one hostage taker</i>

550
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,000
<i>has started back-channel</i>
<i>negotiations for surrender.</i>

551
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,136
What the hell?
<i>Unfortunately, this source couldn't elaborate...</i>

552
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,175
You talking to the pigs
behind my back?

553
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:31,238
Quiet!

554
00:28:35,772 --> 00:28:38,010
I don't know what
that bitch is talking about.

555
00:28:39,148 --> 00:28:41,448
Trying to cut your own deal,
sell me out?

556
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,710
No.

557
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:45,906
Please let us go.
Please.

558
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:52,881
You got something to say?
Huh?

559
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:54,417
Please!

560
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,584
Sit down.

561
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:58,056
That's what I thought.

562
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:20,617
All right, four teams will cover
the perimeter of the house.

563
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:21,953
Alpha team will make
initial entry.

564
00:29:21,955 --> 00:29:23,058
What are you doing?

565
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,555
The situation
is escalating.

566
00:29:24,557 --> 00:29:25,963
One of the hostages
was attacked.

567
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,828
We think he's okay,
but that may not last.

568
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,765
We're afraid that someone is
gonna get seriously hurt, Jane.

569
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,436
Just give me
a little more time.

570
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,435
I'm sorry, Jane.
We tried.

571
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:35,834
We move in five.
All right.

572
00:29:35,836 --> 00:29:36,770
Don't go with them.

573
00:29:36,772 --> 00:29:38,474
We know
what we're doing.

574
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,409
Look,
you don't have to.

575
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,610
Yes, I do.

576
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:43,242
Abbott and Cho, they don't
want to make an arrest.

577
00:29:43,244 --> 00:29:45,240
They want to kill
these guys.

578
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,638
Other people
might get hurt.

579
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,077
It is not gonna go down
like that. We'll be all right.

580
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,645
Y-you don't know that.

581
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:51,982
Lisbon.

582
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:53,584
I have to go.

583
00:29:56,951 --> 00:30:00,418
All right, you two sweep left,
you two stay center.

584
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,291
Lisbon, you're with me.
What the hell's your guy doing?

585
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:04,092
Who?
Jane!

586
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,397
- Hey!
- Jane!

587
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,765
Hey, Jane!
Don't go in there!

588
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:10,260
Jane!
Get back over here!

589
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,235
I'm not armed.

590
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:19,635
Who are you?

591
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:21,609
I can help you
and your brother.

592
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,040
How?

593
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:26,910
You have to release
a hostage first.

594
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,141
Forget it.

595
00:30:30,143 --> 00:30:32,181
I-I-I'm FBI.
Take me instead.

596
00:30:32,183 --> 00:30:33,477
What the hell
is he doing?

597
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:35,518
More valuable,
better leverage.

598
00:30:37,384 --> 00:30:40,656
What's stopping me from
keeping all three of you?

599
00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:42,392
There's too many people
to watch.

600
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:45,161
Come on.
It's a good deal.

601
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:49,905
Sellers!

602
00:30:49,907 --> 00:30:51,305
Bring the crier.

603
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:56,306
Keep your hands up.
Oh, yeah.

604
00:30:56,308 --> 00:30:57,811
Don't be stupid.

605
00:30:57,813 --> 00:30:59,148
What is it now?

606
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,619
This guy wants to trade
for that one.

607
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:08,020
Yeah, whatever.

608
00:31:10,262 --> 00:31:13,229
Okay.

609
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:16,302
Okay.

610
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:35,111
I don't understand.
We were about to go in.

611
00:31:35,113 --> 00:31:37,752
I am just as angry as you are,
but he's already in there.

612
00:31:37,754 --> 00:31:39,015
We might as well
give him some time.

613
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:40,750
Time to do what?

614
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:42,652
He's trying to drive a wedge
between these two guys,

615
00:31:42,654 --> 00:31:44,284
make them turn on each other.

616
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:46,819
Look, if anybody can do that,
Jane can.

617
00:31:48,187 --> 00:31:49,592
Okay.

618
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:52,621
Let's take a pause for a bit.
Half-hour.

619
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:53,925
All right.

620
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:56,662
<i>Honestly, I just --</i>
<i>all of a sudden,</i>

621
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,229
<i>it was all of the S.W.A.T. vans</i>
<i>that came out of nowhere,</i>

622
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:01,765
<i>and -- and this is</i>
<i>such a-a quiet neighborhood.</i>

623
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:04,236
<i>You know, we just --</i>
<i>none of us were expecting this.</i>

624
00:32:04,238 --> 00:32:05,204
He's clear.

625
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:08,771
You stay there.

626
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:10,339
We need to get in touch
with the cops,

627
00:32:10,341 --> 00:32:11,403
get them to move
on that chopper.

628
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:13,170
How the hell
we supposed to do that?

629
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:14,609
I don't know.

630
00:32:14,611 --> 00:32:17,111
Hey! You do not move unless
I tell you to move.

631
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:19,974
I just need to make sure
she's okay.

632
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:21,613
She's okay.

633
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:23,309
You see that bracelet?

634
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,580
She's diabetic.
She could go into shock.

635
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:34,520
Okay. Okay.

636
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:37,552
Thank you.

637
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:39,921
How you feeling?

638
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:43,594
Scared,
but okay basically.

639
00:32:43,596 --> 00:32:46,201
You -- you sure?
You look a little flush.

640
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,299
Feeling, uh,
any numbness?

641
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:53,962
I-I'm not sure.

642
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:56,234
How about your feet?

643
00:32:56,236 --> 00:32:58,235
Y-you feeling numbness
in your feet?

644
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,834
Maybe a little.

645
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:02,208
That's what I thought.

646
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,607
I'm worried you're gonna start
experiencing loss of vision.

647
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:06,575
Your -- your breath
is getting shorter.

648
00:33:06,577 --> 00:33:08,310
Oh -- oh, God.
It's okay.

649
00:33:10,142 --> 00:33:12,106
Oh. Oh, God.

650
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:14,041
Stay calm.
Oh, my God.

651
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:15,545
You got
some trouble here.

652
00:33:15,547 --> 00:33:17,417
She's about to go
into a diabetic coma.

653
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:19,145
Look,
it's not my problem.

654
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:21,186
Don't be stupid. They have
microphones in here.

655
00:33:21,188 --> 00:33:22,723
They -- they have what?
Where?

656
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:26,324
Everywhere. They can hear
every word we're saying.

657
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:27,965
If they
think she's in danger...

658
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,196
they're gonna
come right in.

659
00:33:29,198 --> 00:33:30,500
Damn it, I knew it!

660
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:32,269
Calm down, okay?

661
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:35,165
Okay, j-j-just hold on
a second here.

662
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:39,875
Okay. Look, here's
what we're gonna do.

663
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:41,075
You're gonna watch him,

664
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:43,577
and I'm gonna take her
out the side gate.

665
00:33:44,674 --> 00:33:46,175
Come on. Let's go.

666
00:33:46,177 --> 00:33:48,880
Just calm down.
I'm gonna take you out of here.

667
00:33:48,882 --> 00:33:50,544
Son of a...

668
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:57,718
Such a shame.

669
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:01,484
All this trouble
for $800,000.

670
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:05,890
What do you mean,
$800,000?

671
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:07,426
That's how much
was taken.

672
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:09,425
We got the official count
just a little while ago.

673
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:11,295
It's $600,000!
You don't know nothing!

674
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:13,293
This is not my business.

675
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:15,156
Yeah,
you're damn straight!

676
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:19,459
You got an official count?

677
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,164
I don't
want to take sides,

678
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,901
but there was 800 grand
on that truck.

679
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:25,206
You guys took it all.

680
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:27,871
That's his plan -- the money.
That's a wedge.

681
00:34:27,873 --> 00:34:29,343
You're full of it.

682
00:34:29,345 --> 00:34:31,145
Doesn't sound like
Sellers believes him.

683
00:34:31,147 --> 00:34:34,715
Then let's give him
a reason to believe.

684
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:36,123
<i> And we hear</i>
<i>Elizabeth Kerrigan</i>

685
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,323
<i>has some additional details</i>

686
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,922
<i>about this morning's</i>
<i>armored-truck robbery.</i>

687
00:34:38,924 --> 00:34:40,090
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

688
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:41,393
<i>Indeed, Eric.</i>

689
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:42,393
Hey, turn that up.

690
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:47,695
<i>We've learned it was</i>
<i>just over $800,000</i>

691
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:50,494
<i>stolen from the Gibbs</i>
<i>Security truck this morning.</i>

692
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,365
<i>That official count</i>
<i>from the bank</i>

693
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:54,500
<i>makes this one of the biggest</i>
<i>robberies in recent history.</i>

694
00:34:55,638 --> 00:34:57,466
These people need to get
their facts straight.

695
00:34:58,899 --> 00:35:01,369
What?

696
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,865
Nothing.

697
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:08,095
I'm going
to take a whiz.

698
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:10,251
Well, make it quick.

699
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,310
Did he say something to you
when I was outside?

700
00:35:19,312 --> 00:35:22,277
No, n-not -- not much.

701
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:25,080
He just kept going on about how
he didn't want to die in prison.

702
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,942
Son of a bitch.
Come here.

703
00:35:32,486 --> 00:35:34,780
Get away from the money!

704
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:37,389
I always knew you were
gonna stab me in the back.

705
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:40,221
Me? You're the one
who screwed me.

706
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:42,757
Where did you stash it?
What stash?

707
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:44,325
The extra 200 grand.

708
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:46,564
You better tell me
where it is.

709
00:35:46,566 --> 00:35:47,965

How you doing?

00:39:28,677 --> 00:39:32,113
Places like this
must be hard for you.

746
00:39:32,115 --> 00:39:36,748
Anyway, I don't feel like
going this weekend.

747
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,043
It just
doesn't seem right.

748
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:40,547
Is that okay?

749
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:42,218
Yeah.

750
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:48,056
I can't
do this anymore.

751
00:39:48,058 --> 00:39:50,221
What do you mean?

752
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:52,083
I can't watch you
do this work.

753
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,386
I mean, it -- it...

754
00:39:54,388 --> 00:39:56,787
It could have been you
in that coffin.

755
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,562
And I don't...

756
00:40:02,564 --> 00:40:05,666
I can't go through
that again.

757
00:40:05,668 --> 00:40:07,296
Jane.

758
00:40:07,298 --> 00:40:09,695
You're the one that
walked in that house.

759
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:12,799
Yes, so that
you wouldn't.

760
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:15,270
You could have died.
How is that different?

761
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:17,502
Me dying,
it's -- it's...

762
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:20,038
It doesn't hurt me.

763
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,478
You can't keep pulling me from
the path of oncoming trains.

764
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,086
Yeah? Why not?

765
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:31,547
Because there's always
new trains coming every day.

766
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:38,919
I'm leaving.

767
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,391
Now, you can come with me,
or you can stay here, but...

768
00:40:44,393 --> 00:40:48,297
I have to go.

769
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:50,266
Where you going?

770
00:40:51,637 --> 00:40:53,844
Someplace nice.
