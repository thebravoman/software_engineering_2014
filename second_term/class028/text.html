<p>Hands in the air! don't turn around! Okay. don't turn around! Get on the ground! Hurry up! Give me your gun! I said do it! Your 211 pager. Now! Put it down! Get out of here! Go! The driver's calling it in! Turn it up! Come on! Let's hurry up! Go! Let's go. Come on! Come on! It's this little cabin in the hill country -- rustic, charming, very romantic. Rustic as in no running water or...? Well, would that be a problem? Well, when you said, “Let's go away for the weekend”, I was kind of hoping for the kind of place that leaves a mint on the pillow. Ah. Hey, Cho. Hey. We have three men robbing an armored truck. They subdued the guard, unloaded the cash, got out in 60 seconds. Land speed record. Any witnesses? They gave us approximate heights and weights, but nothing groundbreaking. Tactics match a team that's been knocking off payday loan shops around town. But those were two-man jobs. Well, it sounds like they made a new friend. Yeah. Bank manager says this is the biggest cash delivery of the year. $600,000 in wrapped bricks. Any tracking devices or dye packs? They add those<i> after</i> the cash is broken down. Lucky robbers. Luck is the planning you don't see. What kind of planning? You think someone with the bank is involved. Seems likely. A score this big literally gift-wrapped? All right, we'll get surveillance up on the bank employees. Well, that sounds like a hassle. Let's just ask them. Pull footage from the surveillance cameras in the area. Good morning. Can I have everyone's attention, please? Thank you. Uh, quick question -- which one of you was the accomplice to the robbery this morning? Sorry. Who are you? Patrick Jane, FBI. You? Gil Clark. I'm the branch manager.</p><p>Did you just accuse my people?</p><p>Gil, I did. Agent Cho will explain.</p><p>Hi. How you doing? Nice to meet you.</p><p>Sorry to hear about the robbery.</p><p>So, what the hell is going on here?</p><p>Just be patient, sir.</p><p>Sorry to hear about the robbery.</p><p>This -- I mean, this is outrageous.</p><p>No. Not really. Not yet.</p><p>And thank you. Well, that was my pleasure.</p><p>Uh, let me tell you something about guilt.</p><p>It's physical -- increased perspiration, racing heart.</p><p>But when I just shook your hands,</p><p>most of you were relatively calm and relaxed,</p><p>which is incredible given the circumstances.</p><p>Except for, uh, you, Ken Fletcher, senior teller.</p><p>Your heart, my friend, is racing like a greyhound.</p><p>What is that supposed to mean?</p><p>And your left hand keeps touching your pocket.</p><p>What do you got in there? Hmm?</p><p>Empty it. It --</p><p>Now.</p><p>Looks like a burner.</p><p>Phone you don't want to be traced.</p><p>Who gave this to you, sir?</p><p>I-I-I don't know. I mean, I-I --</p><p>Answer the question. Who gave this to you, sir?</p><p>I don't -- I-I-I just -- I-I --</p><p>Oh, no. I think you killed him.</p><p><font color=#00FF00>♪ The Mentalist 7x10 ♪</font> <font color=#00FFFF>Nothing Gold Can Stay</font> Original Air Date on February 4, 2015</p><p>== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> == <font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font></p><p>Fainting isn't evidence of anything.</p><p>I'm hypoglycemic.

Portis, Austin P.D.</p><p>If you want to take some time to clean up, that's fine.</p><p>I'm okay.</p><p>Seriously, I can wait.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Detective Portis interviewing FBI special Agent Kimball Cho</p><p>regarding the homicide of Michelle Vega.</p><p>Can you walk me through the events</p><p>that led up to the shooting?</p><p>Vega and I went out canvassing a little after 10:00.</p><p>We were checking locations where we believed the three suspects</p><p>had met up with a co-conspirator.</p><p>We'd checked four locations when we arrived at the diner.</p><p>I identified myself to the hostess.</p><p>It was at this point that Vega spotted two of our suspects.</p><p>She brought this to my attention.</p><p>Hey. How did it go with Portis?</p><p>Fine. Seems okay.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Look, you know I have to make the call.</p><p>Vega's file says that her next-of-kin is an aunt in Tampa.</p><p>Did she ever mention anyone else?</p><p>It's her father's sister.</p><p>She's the only living relative as far as I know.</p><p>Okay. All right, well, I thought I'd just check.</p><p>I'll make the call.</p><p>You don't have to.</p><p>Yeah, I do.</p><p>I was there. I should do it.</p><p>Use my office. Her number's on the computer.</p><p>Ms. Vega?</p><p>This is Kimball Cho. I'm with the FBI in Austin.</p><p>Yes, uh, it's about Michelle.</p><p>Is there any more coffee?</p><p>Uh, actually, I think we're out. I'll -- I'll make some more tea.</p><p>No. No, that's okay. I'm fine.</p><p>You don't believe in the afterlife at all, do you?</p><p>No.</p><p>I do.</p><p>Do you think that's foolish?</p><p>No, of course not.</p><p>I just need to believe that she's someplace.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>Austin P.D. might have caught something.</p><p>A few minutes ago, a gas station attendant</p><p>spotted three men in a minivan matching our description.</p><p>They were trying to buy bandages,</p><p>probably for their wounded guy.</p><p>They didn't find what they needed,</p><p>so they bolted. Where?</p><p>Windsor Park. Ah.</p><p>Couple minutes head start from the gas station.</p><p>They couldn't have gotten more than a mile or so.</p><p>We'll have officers canvassing the whole area.</p><p>And a K-9 unit.</p><p>And a couple birds in the air.</p><p>We might want to institute a shelter-in-place order.</p><p>Uh, maybe we should all just take a breath.</p><p>We got these guys contained. We can find them right now.</p><p>Well, or they'll see the cops running around</p><p>and the helicopters flying, and they'll go into hiding.</p><p>No, when you're hunting a wounded animal,</p><p>you don't just start chasing it immediately.</p><p>You'll drive it to ground.</p><p>What's the alternative?</p><p>Well, no dragnet, no helicopters.</p><p>We make them feel safe.</p><p>Or they'll flee and then we'll lose them.</p><p>Well, they're not thinking about fleeing.</p><p>They have more basic needs.</p><p>They were trying to find medical supplies for their wounded man.</p><p>They can't go to the hospital.</p><p>We could put our people outside local drugstores,</p><p>let them come to us.</p><p>I said I'd work with you. What do you want?</p><p>I say we go with Jane's idea.</p><p>All right. How many drugstores are inside that radius?</p><p>A dozen.</p><p>We're gonna need some more bodies.</p><p>All right. We'll take it.</p><p>You stay back and monitor the radio.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>It's Caldwell. I'm at location 1.</p><p>This is Cho, location 2.</p><p>Lisbon, location 7.</p><p>Abbott, location 10.</p><p>Swafford, location 4.</p><p>Millovich, location 5.</p><p>Abbott, location 10. I have one of them.</p><p>He just entered a drugstore -- 1145 Terrapin.</p><p>Everybody move in. We need eyes on all of them.</p><p>And keep it quiet. No sirens, no lights.</p><p>Just left the drugstore, headed south on Terrapin.</p><p>Turn the sirens off!</p><p>He knows we're here.</p><p>Brunell, drop the gun!</p><p>Let the woman go!</p><p>Go to hell!</p><p>Go!</p><p>Get in! Get in!</p><p>Suspects are traveling in a gold minivan</p><p>with Texas license plates.</p><p>They have a hostage. Maintain pursuit.</p><p>Do not -- I repeat, do not -- engage.</p><p>They're inside?</p><p>Yeah. The uniforms couldn't stop them.</p><p>Drove right into the garage.</p><p>The house belongs to Susan Cofield.</p><p>Early 70s, diabetic.</p><p>We don't know if they're allowing her access</p><p>to her medications.</p><p>She lives with her nephew, Phil. He's in there, too.</p><p>Has anyone spoken to them?</p><p>Portis just did, but we don't know what they said.</p><p>He had to go talk to his superiors first.</p><p>We -- we have money, jewelry. We --</p><p>Shut up.</p><p>It's gonna be okay, buddy.</p><p>Okay? Breathe, breathe. Hey.</p><p>Aah, sorry. Hey, hey, look at me.</p><p>Look at me.</p><p>I need you to breathe. Okay?</p><p>It's gonna be okay.</p><p>Okay. What are they asking for?</p><p>Food, a doctor for the wounded guy,</p><p>a helicopter, and a pilot.</p><p>They really are just making it up</p><p>as they're going along, aren't they?</p><p>Normally we should establish trust,</p><p>try to humanize the hostages,</p><p>but I don't know if that's gonna work.</p><p>I don't think these guys have much compassion.</p><p>Well, I wouldn't say that.</p><p>It's a question of who they have compassion for.</p><p>These guys killed Vega.</p><p>Sellers did, not Ace.</p><p>They're in there</p><p>because he was trying to get medicine for his brother.</p><p>That's compassion.</p><p>Should we send Tommy a doctor?</p><p>Trade that for releasing one of the hostages?</p><p>Well, I was gonna say the opposite.</p><p>Ace is desperate.</p><p>I-if we help him, then we lose our best leverage.</p><p>Our best bet is to just let Tommy suffer.</p><p>Sellers is in this for the money.</p><p>I mean, he'd probably just as well let Tommy die.</p><p>Well, that's even better. We drive a wedge between them.</p><p>Divide and conquer.</p><p>Okay. Let's try it.</p><p>Is there anything we can give them?</p><p>Try anything, she dies.</p><p>I won't. Here.</p><p>What about a doctor?</p><p>My brother's hurt real bad.</p><p>Yeah, you can have a doctor.</p><p>When? As soon as you surrender.</p><p><i> ...Altercation</i> <i>with two Austin FBI agents</i></p><p><i>at the Tastee pancake house.</i></p><p><i>Shots were fired.</i> <i>One of the FBI agents was hit.</i></p><p>What were you talking to the cops about?</p><p><i>She was pronounced dead at the hospital.</i> Nothing.</p><p><i>At this point, all three of</i> <i>these armed men are holed up...</i></p><p>We said no secrets.</p><p>I asked if we can get a doctor.</p><p>They're not gonna give you that</p><p>unless you give something up, like one of them,</p><p>and there is no way in hell I'm doing that.</p><p>He is dying.</p><p>Yeah, and it's not my fault the dude got himself shot.</p><p><i>...as soon as</i> <i>we have anything more.</i></p><p>I'm not going back to jail to save his sorry ass.</p><p>We agreed that we were gonna get some help.</p><p>Yeah, and that's before we had a million cops on our ass.</p><p>Well, looks like it's working.</p><p>You wanted division, you got it.</p><p>Well, it's a good start, but we need to stir the pot.</p><p>Can you hear a television on in there?</p><p>Sounds like the local news.</p><p>Probably watching their own coverage.</p><p>Excellent.</p><p>Can I talk to you?</p><p>I got a look inside.</p><p>I think if we went in, we could take them out.</p><p>There's three armed men in there.
