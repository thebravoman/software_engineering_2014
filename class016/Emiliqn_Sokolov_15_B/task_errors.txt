#find all the files with 10 digits in them; -> comment

waht kind of files!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
find diggits where ????????????????? in name in file.content ????????????

why is it required xml.writer why not simple function why to waste time scp-ing 2 seperated files when time is limmited??


Why making **** task for second time ??? why not making simple and human readble tasks!!!!!!!


Tip for next time concretizate with what files are we working with, diferent files require diferent parsing methods you cant parse all files with only one parser!!!!
 If u can't make simple task ask your friends do they understand it?
 
 and then commit them, dont commit just so you can have homewrok think for ppls who need to solve your task
or atleast try and solve it by yourself if you can't make new one!
