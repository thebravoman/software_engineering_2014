=begin
1. You have a CSV file with names in 2 rows. 
First row is Firstname, second is a number, which is either 1 or 0.
	example:
	FirstName,1
	Firstname2,0


2. Find the all the people with 0 and print them in HTML format, sorted in ASC order(by their names).
2.1 The HTML needs to be in the form of:
	<html>
	<body>
		<p> Fname </p>
		<p> Peshko </p>
	<body>
	</html>

3.You need to use the html writer, named html_writer.rb

=end

require 'csv'
require_relative "html_writer.rb"

names = Hash.new
CSV.foreach("csvnames.csv") do |row|

	name = row.inspect.split(",").first.split('"')[1]
	number = row.inspect.split(",").last.split('"')[1].to_s

	if number == "1"
		names[name] = number
	end

end
names = Hash[names.sort_by { |k,v| k }] 

writer = HTMLwriter.new
writer.write names
