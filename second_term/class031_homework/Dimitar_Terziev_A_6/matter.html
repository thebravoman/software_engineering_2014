Before the 20th century, the term<a href = "matter.html"> matter </a>included ordinary<a href = "matter.html"> matter </a>composed of <a href = "atom.html"> atoms </a> and excluded other energy phenomena such as light or sound. This concept of<a href = "matter.html"> matter </a>may be generalized from <a href = "atom.html"> atoms </a> to include any objects having mass even when at rest, but this is ill-defined because an object's mass can arise from its( possibly massless) constituents ' motion and interaction energies. Thus,<a href = "matter.html"> matter </a>does not have a universal definition, nor is it a fundamental concept in physics today. <a href = "matter.html"> Matter </a> is also used loosely as a general term for the substance that makes up all observable physical objects.
